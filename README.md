# Web-Scraping
 Web Scraping is often done to extract useful data from websites automatically through scripts (usually python) rather than manual copy paste. You know this data can be used for multiple applications like:
 - Gathering Research data
 - Collecting news and srticles
 - Track prices on ecom websites
 - Extract Job listings
 - Generate leads


Some popular Python libraries that are used for this are:
Requests (To fetch web pages)
BeautifulSoup (Parse HTML - for static websites)
Selenium (for dynamic content)

Here, I have used each of these methods for handling web scraping. Follow the Jupyter notebook that is self-explainatory and easy to understand.
